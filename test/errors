GLFW error:

[xcb] Extra reply data still left in queue
[xcb] This is most likely caused by a broken X extension library
[xcb] Aborting, sorry about that.
main: ../../src/xcb_io.c:580: _XReply: Assertion `!xcb_xlib_extra_reply_data_left' failed.
Aborted (core dumped)

Fixed: window->poll_events() (glfwPollEvents) must be called after window->update() (glfwSwapBuffers) 



GLFW error:

X connection to `Xï¿½ broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).

Fixed: comment out window->set_viewport() (glViewport)



GLFW error:

Segmentation fault (core dumped)

Fixed: change dokun::Window pointer from smart pointer to `dokun::Window window;`
    Basically, any kind or pointers (either raw or smart) will trigger this error.
